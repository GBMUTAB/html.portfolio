      After completing my high school, I moved to <em>USA, Arkansas</em>. I
      lived in <em>Springdale</em> and worked there.
    </p>
    <p>
      After almost two years, I moved to <em>Alaska</em>, started a fishing
      career. I worked there as processor for 5 years.

    <p>
      After long years working in a boat, I decided to quit fishing, moved in to
      <em>Las Vegas</em> and pursue a new career as a web developer while
      working two full time jobs.
